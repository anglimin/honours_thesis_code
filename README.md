### Title: Identifying Discrepancies within current transport initiatives: An Urban Informatics Approach

This repository contains the scripts that I have used for my methodology.<br /> 
In sequential order, the scripts are executed as follow: 
  1. reddit.py and twitter.py
  2. topic_modelling.py
  3. Visualisation_Stationarity.py

Following diagram showcases the methodology flow (for pure scripting), as well as, the output and their file names after each run.<br />

#### Disclaimer 1: Raw data will not be supplemented in this repository to prevent breach of privacy. Refer to Appendix C to understand data schema of the raw and processed data. <br />
#### Disclaimer 2: I have also attached the script for identifying locations with Reddit commments through spaCy Named Entity Recognition (NER). However, these results are not utilised for subsequent analysis. Moreover, the trained NER model (spacy_sg) may not be the best identifier of Singapore's locations in lieu of various reasons that will not be covered in this thesis.
